# JustOneBlog

## The Mission

JustOneBlog aught to be a lightweight, super fancy blog software.

* NoDB used for data storage! Instead save ressources directly to JSON files.
* RESTlike interface! I don't know if it's even possible to do something truly RESTfull in PHP.
* Yes, PHP it is! Spiced with some Symfony2 components:
  * Symfony/ClassLoader
  * Symfony/HttpFoundation
  * Symfony/Routing
  * Symfony/Validator
  * ...
* OnePage design! Therefore, there will be a lot of JS.
  * knockout.js
* Edit posts with markdown!
* BDD!
  * noonat/pecs for PHP
  * pivotal/jasmine for JS

## Todos

* Make some thoughts about use cases
* Bootstrap it
